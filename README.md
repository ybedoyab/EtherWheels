## Description

EtherWheels is a decentralized carpooling platform powered by Web3 technology and Campnetwork. It revolutionizes traditional carpooling systems by providing a transparent, secure, and community-driven alternative.

## Project Details

### Track
We participated in Track 2 - Web3 Social of OPL X 0G X CAMP AI+WEB3 & SOCIAL HACKATHON, focusing on building a decentralized social project using Campnetwork technology.

### Problem Statement
Traditional carpooling systems suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency in fare calculations, safety concerns, and centralized control. EtherWheels addresses these challenges by introducing:

- **Fair Fare Calculations:** Transparent and equitable pricing based on factors like distance, time, and contribution.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Decentralized identity verification and reputation systems.
- **Decentralized Control:** Empowering users with ownership of their data and governance over the platform's operations.

## Features

- **Fair Fare Calculation:** Utilizes smart contracts for transparent and equitable pricing.
- **Decentralized Identity Verification:** Ensures trust and accountability within the community.
- **Community Governance:** Empowers users with ownership of data and platform operations.
- **Seamless Integration with Campnetwork:** Leverages Campnetwork technology for decentralized operations.

## Technologies Used
